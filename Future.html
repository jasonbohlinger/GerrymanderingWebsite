                        <p>We are seeking to grow the presence of our website so that we can bring more awareness 
                            to the issues that are caused by gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is not just a one party 
                            issue, as both parties are gerrymandering their districts.

                        <p>“It has been almost a decade since the 2010 cycle of redistricting, and the country is 
                            still reckoning with the impact. Last May, the Center for American Progress published a 
                            report that found that unfairly drawn congressional districts shifted, on average, a whopping 
                            59 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives during the 2012, 2014, and 2016 elections. 
                            That means that every other November, 59 politicians that would not have been elected based on 
                            statewide voter support for their party won anyway because the lines were drawn in their favor—often 
                            by their allies in the Republican or Democratic Party” <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/impact-partisan-gerrymandering/">(Tausanovitch)</a>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            59 seats out of the 435 seats in the house of representatives were swayed by gerrymandering, or about 13%. 
                            This means that 13% of our constituents were only elected because the in party unfairly drew districts to 
                            benefit their party. This seems extremely unfair, as 13% of the American population, almost 44 million 
                            people, have had their votes unfairly counted. One might argue, just draw all districts evenly, but 
                            this poses a different question, maybe districts should be drawn and gerrymandered, but for what purpose? 
                            Should districts be drawn due to some demographic or criteria? Districts can be drawn to exclude the 
                            vote of some by the in party, but they can also be drawn to include the vote of some other demographics 
                            too. Let's say there is an area that has a high concentration of LBTQ+ population, some might argue 
                            that they should have their own district so that their vote and opinion can be heard. This might involve 
                            drawing an obscure district, but it might make sense to do this. Other areas might have a high 
                            percentage of women or groups of different similar backgrounds/ethnicities that might have different 
                            views/beliefs. In many regards, it makes sense to draw districts, but it is hard to limit this power 
                            and regulate if they are being drawn for “good reasons”. It is a complicated issue that is more 
                            about how we want our districts to be drawn and what constitutes a district versus building a 
                            model to computationally redistrict.
