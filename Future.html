            <div class="example-box">
                <p>We are seeking to grow the presence of our website so that we can bring more awareness 
                    to the issues that are caused by gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is not just a one party 
                    issue, as both parties are gerrymandering their districts. </p>
                <p>“It has been almost a decade since the 2010 cycle of redistricting, and the country is 
                    still reckoning with the impact. Last May, the Center for American Progress published a 
                    report that found that unfairly drawn congressional districts shifted, on average, a whopping 
                    59 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives during the 2012, 2014, and 2016 elections. 
                    That means that every other November, 59 politicians that would not have been elected based on 
                    statewide voter support for their party won anyway because the lines were drawn in their favor—often 
                    by their allies in the Republican or Democratic Party” <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/impact-partisan-gerrymandering/">(Tausanovitch)</a>.</p>
