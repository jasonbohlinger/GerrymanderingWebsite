                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Our intervention is an easy to use website which teaches users about gerrymandering and the effects it has on elections. 
                    The website will show examples of past elections and the districts involved then give a detailed description on how the effects of gerrymandering 
                    caused this outcome. In addition the website will include our own model for redistricting, demonstrating the difference in districts and election 
                    outcomes without the effect of gerrymandering. The model will include pseudo code which will explain each step of the redistricting model, allowing 
                    for those with little computer science knowledge to understand what the code is actually doing. Our main goal is to raise awareness for this issue 
                    and draw the attention of government officials who could use our model to create more fair districts and election outcomes. </p>
