                        <h1>What is Gerrymandering?</h1>
                        <p><span class="tab"></span>Gerrymandering is the intentional manipulation of vote district boundaries to favor 
                            one group/party over another. We see this in the United States from both parties, 
                            who look to either maintain their control through controlling who votes for them 
                            or by trying to minimize the value of their opponents' votes and power. This is 
                            often done on the state level by the state legislature, who draw the districts for 
                            their state that are used to vote in national elections, for representation in the 
                            house of representatives. The effects of gerrymandering can be seen not only in national 
                            elections, but also in much smaller scales like school districts. School districts are 
                            gerrymandered to keep low income students out, which is often segregating people by race. 
                            Because our voting system has winner-take-all electoral systems in districts, a legislative 
                            body is elected by dividing the jurisdiction into geographic constituencies, each electing 
                            exactly one representative. Although this may result in diverse representation, due to 
                            different political groups making up majorities of different districts, within each district, 
                            only one political party or group will be able to select a candidate.</p>
                        <p><span class="tab"></span>Computer programming, otherwise known as coding, is the process of performing a 
                            particular computation, usually by designing/building an executable computer program. 
                            Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' 
                            accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms.</p>

                        <h1>How Can Coding Combine With Gerrymandering?</h1>
                        <p><span class="tab"></span>For years, the politics of redistricting have led individuals to commit this dishonest act. 
                            Although the definition of gerrymandering is clear, it is sometimes difficult to point out 
                            and find examples and proof of gerrymandering. The use of programming and algorithms has been 
                            highlighted as a theoretical solution to unbiasedly drawing legislative boundaries. People have 
                            been trying to accomplish this task by identifying gerrymandering, quantifying gerrymandering, 
                            and finally, redrawing district boundaries to fix the gerrymandering. </p>

                        <p><span class="tab"></span>We have discovered that many people (especially fellow students at Chapman) do not truly 
                            understand what Gerrymandering is. We want to raise awareness and educate people about gerrymandering, and the 
                            effects it has on our democracy.</p>
